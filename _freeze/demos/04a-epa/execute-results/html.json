Instead of manually computing EPA based on your own EP estimates, we'll just use the `nflfastR` values since: (1) they're extremely popular and (2) the code to compute EPA is really annoying to write (it's a sloppy situation of `ifelse`/`case_when` situations). The code that follows in this demo borrows heavily from the [`nflfastR` beginner's guide](https://www.nflfastr.com/articles/beginners_guide.html). \n\nYou will need the following packages installed (besides the `tidyverse`):\n\n+ [`ggrepel`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggrepel/vignettes/ggrepel.html)\n\n+ [`nflreadr`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/)\n\n+ [`nflplotR`](https://nflplotr.nflverse.com/)\n\nFor context, both `nflreadr` and `nflplotR` are packages inside the [`nflverse`](https://nflverse.nflverse.com/). \n\n\n## Reading in NFL play-by-play data\n\nWe'll start by reading in the play-by-play data from NFL games during the 2024 regular season. Since we are interested in creating statistics based on EPA, we will only consider rows in the dataset where `epa` is not missing:. The code chunk below reads in the data using `nflreadr`. You'll notice that the play-by-play data contains a large number of columns with various statistics and other measurements provided by `nflfastR`. You can find a full glossary of the columns [here](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/articles/dictionary_pbp.html).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(nflreadr)\n\n# Load the 2024 data:\nnfl_2024_pbp <- load_pbp(2024) |>\n  # Only use games from the regular season\n  filter(season_type == \"REG\", \n         # and where epa is not missing along with other issues for the \n         # teams involved either offense (posteam) or defense (defteam)\n         !is.na(epa), !is.na(posteam), posteam != \"\",\n         !is.na(defteam), defteam != \"\")\n\n# Preview the data\nnfl_2024_pbp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 44,414 × 372\n   play_id game_id     old_game_id home_team away_team season_type  week posteam\n     <dbl> <chr>       <chr>       <chr>     <chr>     <chr>       <int> <chr>  \n 1      40 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 2      61 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 3      83 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 4     108 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 5     133 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 6     155 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 7     177 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 8     199 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n 9     224 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n10     265 2024_01_AR… 2024090801  BUF       ARI       REG             1 ARI    \n# ℹ 44,404 more rows\n# ℹ 364 more variables: posteam_type <chr>, defteam <chr>, side_of_field <chr>,\n#   yardline_100 <dbl>, game_date <chr>, quarter_seconds_remaining <dbl>,\n#   half_seconds_remaining <dbl>, game_seconds_remaining <dbl>,\n#   game_half <chr>, quarter_end <dbl>, drive <dbl>, sp <dbl>, qtr <dbl>,\n#   down <dbl>, goal_to_go <int>, time <chr>, yrdln <chr>, ydstogo <dbl>,\n#   ydsnet <dbl>, desc <chr>, play_type <chr>, yards_gained <dbl>, …\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Summarizing and Visualizing Total EPA\n\nWith this dataset, we're now ready to actually compute various EPA-related statistics to measure team performance. The following code chunk computes the total EPA (i.e., sum of EPA), EPA per play, and success rate for each team when they are on offense:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nteam_off_summary <- nfl_2024_pbp |>\n  group_by(posteam) |>\n  summarize(total_epa = sum(epa),\n            ave_epa = mean(epa),\n            success_rate = mean(as.numeric(epa > 0)),\n            .groups = \"drop\")\nteam_off_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 32 × 4\n   posteam total_epa ave_epa success_rate\n   <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>        <dbl>\n 1 ARI          85.6  0.0628        0.508\n 2 ATL          16.1  0.0114        0.502\n 3 BAL         195.   0.140         0.514\n 4 BUF         185.   0.136         0.5  \n 5 CAR         -52.8 -0.0392        0.460\n 6 CHI         -72.5 -0.0512        0.434\n 7 CIN         127.   0.0897        0.508\n 8 CLE        -221.  -0.151         0.406\n 9 DAL         -66.3 -0.0450        0.452\n10 DEN          35.7  0.0258        0.470\n# ℹ 22 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we can display a ranking of the teams based on the total EPA via a bar chart ordered by the total EPA. For cosmetics, I flip the x/y axes here to display the bars horizontally, making the team abbreviations easier to see along the left-hand side. Note the use of `reorder()` to reorder the teams by their `total_epa`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nteam_off_summary |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(posteam, total_epa), \n             y = total_epa)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Team\", y = \"Total EPA on offense\",\n       caption = \"Data courtesy of nflreadr\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](04a-epa_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n__NOTE: From looking at this visual, we observe symmetry in terms of team with positive and negative total EPA. If we observed an imbalance, with favoring of one direction over another, then I would be concerned about the EPA values. Such type of asymmetry may be due to changes in the scoring environment for a particular season relative to previous seasons in the expected points model's training dataset.__\n\nWe can easily change the bar colors to match each team's respective color(s) by loading in team data via `load_teams()` from `nflreadr`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nteam_data <- load_teams()\nteam_data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n── nflverse team graphics ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nℹ Data updated: 2025-01-27 16:36:39 EST\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 32 × 16\n   team_abbr team_name      team_id team_nick team_conf team_division team_color\n   <chr>     <chr>          <chr>   <chr>     <chr>     <chr>         <chr>     \n 1 ARI       Arizona Cardi… 3800    Cardinals NFC       NFC West      #97233F   \n 2 ATL       Atlanta Falco… 0200    Falcons   NFC       NFC South     #A71930   \n 3 BAL       Baltimore Rav… 0325    Ravens    AFC       AFC North     #241773   \n 4 BUF       Buffalo Bills  0610    Bills     AFC       AFC East      #00338D   \n 5 CAR       Carolina Pant… 0750    Panthers  NFC       NFC South     #0085CA   \n 6 CHI       Chicago Bears  0810    Bears     NFC       NFC North     #0B162A   \n 7 CIN       Cincinnati Be… 0920    Bengals   AFC       AFC North     #FB4F14   \n 8 CLE       Cleveland Bro… 1050    Browns    AFC       AFC North     #FF3C00   \n 9 DAL       Dallas Cowboys 1200    Cowboys   NFC       NFC East      #002244   \n10 DEN       Denver Broncos 1400    Broncos   AFC       AFC West      #002244   \n# ℹ 22 more rows\n# ℹ 9 more variables: team_color2 <chr>, team_color3 <chr>, team_color4 <chr>,\n#   team_logo_wikipedia <chr>, team_logo_espn <chr>, team_wordmark <chr>,\n#   team_conference_logo <chr>, team_league_logo <chr>, team_logo_squared <chr>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo add the colors to our figure, we can join the `team_color` to our summary table:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nteam_off_summary <- team_off_summary |>\n  inner_join(dplyr::select(team_data, team_abbr, team_color),\n             by = c(\"posteam\" = \"team_abbr\"))\nteam_off_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 32 × 5\n   posteam total_epa ave_epa success_rate team_color\n   <chr>       <dbl>   <dbl>        <dbl> <chr>     \n 1 ARI          85.6  0.0628        0.508 #97233F   \n 2 ATL          16.1  0.0114        0.502 #A71930   \n 3 BAL         195.   0.140         0.514 #241773   \n 4 BUF         185.   0.136         0.5   #00338D   \n 5 CAR         -52.8 -0.0392        0.460 #0085CA   \n 6 CHI         -72.5 -0.0512        0.434 #0B162A   \n 7 CIN         127.   0.0897        0.508 #FB4F14   \n 8 CLE        -221.  -0.151         0.406 #FF3C00   \n 9 DAL         -66.3 -0.0450        0.452 #002244   \n10 DEN          35.7  0.0258        0.470 #002244   \n# ℹ 22 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd then recreate our bar chart using these colors:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nteam_off_summary |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(posteam, total_epa), \n             y = total_epa)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",\n           #

As a word of caution, using the team logos may not be optimal all the time since their size can lead to overlap making it difficult to see what is directly going on. But using `geom_nfl_logos()` we can display the team logos instead of points, along with adjustments for the transparency and size of the logos. Furthermore, `nflplotR` includes a useful `geom_mean_lines()` function to display the averages for the `x` and `y` aesthetics via red dashed lines (although you can customize them).

The following code first finds the passing plays, and then computes similar EPA-based statistics as before but at the passer-level instead of team-level. Additionally, we'll compute completion percentage over expectation (CPOE) based on the `nflfastr` model for completion probability where `cpoe` is simply `complete_pass - cp` (`complete_pass` is a binary indicator for whether or not the pass is complete and `cp` is the predicted probability of a complete pass).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npasser_summary <- nfl_2024_pbp |>\n  filter(play_type == \"pass\") |>\n  # group by the passer play name and id columns:\n  group_by(passer_player_name, passer_player_id) |>\n  # Now summarize (also storing the last team they were on)\n  summarize(team = last(posteam),\n            n_plays = n(),\n            ave_epa = mean(epa),\n            success_rate = mean(epa > 0),\n            cpoe = mean(cpoe, na.rm = TRUE),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  # Join the team colors with left_join\n  left_join(dplyr::select(team_data, team_abbr, team_color),\n            by = c(\"team\" = \"team_abbr\"))\npasser_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 110 × 8\n   passer_player_name passer_player_id team  n_plays  ave_epa success_rate\n   <chr>              <chr>            <chr>   <int>    <dbl>        <dbl>\n 1 A.Cole             00-0035190       LV          1  4.33           1    \n 2 A.Dalton           00-0027973       CAR       168 -0.151          0.411\n 3 A.Lazard           00-0034521       NYJ         1 -1.01           0    \n 4 A.Mitchell         00-0039890       IND         1  2.45           1    \n 5 A.O'Connell        00-0038579       LV        254  0.00981        0.441\n 6 A.Richardson       00-0039164       IND       277 -0.159          0.347\n 7 A.Rodgers          00-0023459       NYJ       627 -0.00202        0.434\n 8 A.St. Brown        00-0036963       DET         1  1.72           1    \n 9 B.Allen            00-0032434       SF         32 -0.546          0.344\n10 B.Anger            00-0029692       DAL         2 -2.84           0    \n# ℹ 100 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: cpoe <dbl>, team_color <chr>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can now visualize the CPOE and EPA per passing play (including sacks) for QBs during the 2024 season (with an arbitrary threshold of at least 200 plays for ease):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npasser_summary |>\n  filter(n_plays >= 200) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = cpoe, y = ave_epa)) +\n  # Note the filter within here could have been avoided if I just filtered\n  # beforehand to store a separate dataset entirely:\n  geom_point(color = pull(filter(passer_summary, \n                                 n_plays >= 200), \n                          team_color),\n             aes(size = n_plays),\n             alpha = 0.75) +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = passer_player_name)) +\n  # Add mean lines\n  geom_mean_lines(aes(x0 = cpoe, y0 = ave_epa)) +\n  labs(x = \"Completion percentage over expectation (based on nflfastR model)\",\n       y = \"EPA per passing play (with sacks included)\",\n       caption = \"Data courtesy of nflreadr\",\n       size = \"Number of plays\") +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\nWarning: ggrepel: 1 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps).

There's a great function within `nflreadr` called [`load_ftn_charting()`](https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/reference/load_ftn_charting.html) that provides a variety of additional context (e.g., is it a screen pass, play-action pass, etc.) based on manual charting courtesy of [FTNData.com](FTNData.com).\n\n+ [`nfl_data_py`](https://pypi.org/project/nfl-data-py/) is the Python equivalent that is just a wrapper for `nflfastR` data.\n\n+ [Open Source Football](https://opensourcefootball.com/) - a cool website that is effectively a repository of work people have done with public football data, including code. Note that there are likely mistakes made in the various posts regarding modeling techniques, but you'll find ways to access interesting datasets and potentially get ideas for projects.\n\n+ A useful coding book with interesting examples: [https://bradcongelio.com/nfl-analytics-with-r-book/](https://bradcongelio.com/nfl-analytics-with-r-book/) (note that I do not recommend the modeling sections of the book since many important details are omitted).\n\n+ [`cfbfastR`](https://cfbfastr.sportsdataverse.org/) for college football data (including recruiting data!).\n\n+ [`ffverse`](https://www.ffverse.com/) for all things fantasy football.\n\n\n\n",
