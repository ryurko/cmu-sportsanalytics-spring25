We previously considered a discrete prior distribution for her probability of making a field goal $\\pi$. In this demo, we're going to replace the discrete prior *with a continuous Beta distribution*. This will provide us with a foundational example of using conjugate priors in Bayesian statistics. Although we are only considering Caitlin Clark's FG% in this demo, this type of example can be applied to a wide variety of problems in sports that are based on considering some type of success out of a number of trials.\n\nWe will use two datasets in this demo: (1) season statistics WNBA players during the 2024 season and (2) a game log of Caitlin Clark's statistics in her rookie WNBA season. Both of these files were created using the `init_clark_wnba_game_log.R` script located in the demos/week6 folder on Canvas. The following code chunk reads in data (assuming they are in the correct directory):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nwnba_player_stats <- read_csv(here::here(\"data/wnba_player_stats_2024.csv\"))\nclark_game_log <- \n  read_csv(here::here(\"data/caitlin_clark_wnba_game_log_2024.csv\"))\n\n# View a preview of the datasets:\nwnba_player_stats\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 158 × 8\n   athlete_id athlete_display_name school  minutes fg_made fg_att position\n        <dbl> <chr>                <chr>     <dbl>   <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>   \n 1        585 Diana Taurasi        Mercury    1122     188    465 G       \n 2        869 DeWanna Bonner       Sun        1523     250    608 F       \n 3        887 Sami Whitcomb        Storm       613      72    209 G       \n 4        918 Tina Charles         Dream      1218     255    556 C       \n 5        924 Alysha Clark         Aces       1129      97    225 F       \n 6        981 Courtney Vandersloot Liberty     862     103    234 G       \n 7       1004 Sydney Colson        Aces        275      28     71 G       \n 8       1054 Tiffany Hayes        Aces        843     132    263 G       \n 9       1068 Nneka Ogwumike       Storm      1275     270    536 F       \n10    2284331 Emma Cannon          Aces         10       2      3 F       \n# ℹ 148 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: fg_percentage <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nclark_game_log\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 43 × 7\n     game_id game_date  minutes field_goals_made field_goals_attempted\n       <dbl> <date>       <dbl>            <dbl>                 <dbl>\n 1 401721254 2024-09-25      40               10                    23\n 2 401721253 2024-09-22      36                4                    17\n 3 401620454 2024-09-19      20                2                     5\n 4 401620441 2024-09-15      36               10                    22\n 5 401620437 2024-09-13      34                7                    18\n 6 401620432 2024-09-11      38                6                    22\n 7 401620425 2024-09-08      45                7                    17\n 8 401620421 2024-09-06      36                8                    21\n 9 401620416 2024-09-04      40                8                    17\n10 401620409 2024-09-01      37               10                    19\n# ℹ 33 more rows\n# ℹ 2 more variables: opponent_team_display_name <chr>, fg_percentage <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Empirical Bayes - Beta Prior Distribution\n\nFor our first step, we need a prior distribution for Clark's probability of making a field goal, as denoted by parameter $\\pi$. As discussed in lecture, the [Beta distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) is a popular choice for the prior distribution for a probability since it is bounded between 0 and 1. The Beta distribution is defined by shape parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, which (as the name states) determine the shape of the distribution - altering the mean, mode(s), and variance. In the Bayesian syntax, parameters for prior distributions are called __hyperparameters__. Thus, we need to determine our choice for the __hyperparameters__ $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ in this particular context to serve as the prior distribution for Caitlin Clark's probability of making a field goal $\\pi$.\n\nAlthough we could consider a purely subjective approach for this (i.e., choose values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ based on prior belief about what the mean, mode, and variance are for $\\pi$), in this example we will consider an __empirical Bayes__ approach. Unlike traditional Bayesian statistics, which specifies a prior before observing any data, __Empirical Bayes__ uses data to estimate the prior distribution's hyperparameters. \n\nIn this example, we will use the `wnba_player_stats` table to estimate the hyperparameters for our Beta prior. However, the table currently includes a number of players with a relatively low number of field goal attempts (`fg_att`). For ease, we will only consider players with at least 100 FG attempts (excluding Caitlin Clark). Additionally, we will only consider `Guard` position players (indicated by `position == \"G\"`) to only consider players that are similar to Clark.. The following code chunk filters the data and visualizes the distribution of FG%s (`fg_percentage`) for the considered players:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# First filter to the players of interest\nprior_data <- wnba_player_stats |>\n  filter(fg_att >= 100, position == \"G\",\n         athlete_display_name != \"Caitlin Clark\")\n\nprior_data |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = fg_percentage)) +\n  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.05),\n                 closed = \"left\", color = \"black\",\n                 fill = \"gray\") +\n  labs(x = \"FG%\", y = \"Number of players\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-beta-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNext, we can use the [`fitdistr()` function from the MASS package](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/MASS/html/fitdistr.html) to estimate the values for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_beta_model <- MASS::fitdistr(prior_data$fg_percentage, \n                                   dbeta, \n                                   # Need starting values\n                                   start = list(shape1 = 5, shape2 = 8))\n\n# Grab the values:\nprior_alpha_shape <- prior_beta_model$estimate[1]\nprior_beta_shape <- prior_beta_model$estimate[2]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThese values correspond to:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_alpha_shape\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  shape1 \n45.88581 \n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_beta_shape\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  shape2 \n68.68621 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nwhere `shape1` is $\\alpha$ and `shape2` is $\\beta$.\n\n\nWe can overlay this Beta density function based on these hyperparameters on top our histogram using `stat_function()`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprior_data |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = fg_percentage)) +\n  # Display on density scale\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density)),\n                 breaks = seq(0, 1, by = 0.05),\n                 closed = \"left\", color = \"black\",\n                 fill = \"gray\") +\n  # Now draw Beta distribution with these hyperparameters:\n  stat_function(fun = dbeta, color = \"red\", xlim = c(0, 1),\n                args = list(shape1 = prior_alpha_shape, \n                            shape2 = prior_beta_shape)) +\n  labs(x = \"FG%\", y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-beta-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nArguably, this does not seem like the best fit for the data... however, we're going to be lazy about this for now and proceed with this choice for the prior.\n\n## Binomial Likelihood Function\n\nWe will use the Binomial model for Clark's FG% ($\\pi$) based on the number of shots she made in her WNBA debut on May 14th 2024, where she made 5 of 15 FG attempts. Unlike the `intro_bayes.qmd` demo, all values in the interval between 0 and 1 are possible - as reflected in the Beta prior distribution. For ease, we'll make a similar visual to the intro demo that displays the Binomial probability for a grid of possible $\\pi$ values, with the observed $y = 5$ out of $n = 15$ shot attempts indicated in black:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# First create a table with values from 0 to 15 to indicate the number of \n# made field goals:\nfield_goal_data <- tibble(made_fg = 0:15, n_fg = 15)\n\n# Now, loop over a vector of values for the potential pi:\npotential_pi <- seq(0.1, 0.9, by = 0.1)\n\n# Create a stacked dataset containing the Binomial probability of observing\n# the number of made_fg given pi and n_fg for each of the three values of pi:\nfield_goal_probs <- map_dfr(potential_pi,\n                            function(pi) {\n                              \n                              field_goal_data |>\n                                mutate(fg_pi = pi,\n                                       binom_pmf = dbinom(made_fg, n_fg, fg_pi))\n                              \n                            }) |>\n  # Add an indicator denoting the observed outcome:\n  mutate(is_observed = ifelse(made_fg == 5, \"yes\", \"no\"))\n\n# And now create a plot displaying the probabilities for these choice of pis\nfield_goal_probs |>\n  # Make a new label using fg_pi:\n  mutate(binom_label = paste0(\"Binomial(15, \", fg_pi, \")\")) |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = made_fg, y = binom_pmf, color = is_observed)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(fill = is_observed), stat = \"identity\", width = 0.1) +\n  geom_point() +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"black\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"gray\", \"black\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~binom_label, ncol = 3) +\n  labs(x = \"y\", y = expression(paste(\"f(y|\", pi, \")\"))) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        strip.background = element_blank(),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 14))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-beta-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIf we focus on the observed values with $y = 5$, we can view the likelihood as a function of the choice of $\\pi$. Rather than view this likelihood only for the nine $\\pi$ values in the grid of plots above, we need to compute this across the continuous range of $\\pi$ values. The following code chunk displays this likelihood function across the full range of $\\pi$ (with the nine values from above highlighted in black):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfield_goal_probs |>\n  # only use the rows for the observed outcome\n  filter(is_observed == \"yes\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = fg_pi, y = binom_pmf)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.001,\n           color = \"black\", fill = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"black\", size = 4) +\n  stat_function(fun = dbinom, color = \"red\", xlim = c(0, 1),\n                args = list(x = 5, \n                            size = 15)) +\n  labs(x = expression(pi), y = expression(paste(\"L(\", pi, \"|y = 5)\"))) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(strip.background = element_blank(),\n        strip.text = element_text(size = 14))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-beta-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Beta Posterior\n\nSince we now have the two pieces in place, prior and likelihood, we can arrive at the posterior distribution for Clark's $\\pi$. Before arriving at the posterior, we'll visualize the prior and __a scaled version__ of the likelihood (so that it integrates to 1) together on the same plot using a convenient function from the [`bayesrules` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesrules/vignettes/conjugate-families.html):\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(bayesrules)\nplot_beta_binomial(alpha = prior_alpha_shape, beta = prior_beta_shape, \n                   y = 5, n = 15, \n                   prior = TRUE, likelihood = TRUE, posterior = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-beta-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAs discussed in lecture, the use of a Beta prior with the Binomial likelihood results in a Beta posterior distribution for $\\pi$. This is because the Beta distribution is the __conjugate prior__ for Binomial likelihood, meaning that the posterior is the same model family as the prior. The `bayesrule` package has a `summarize_beta_binomial()` function that returns the parameters for the prior and posterior under this form:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummarize_beta_binomial(prior_alpha_shape, prior_beta_shape,\n                        y = 5, n = 15)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      model    alpha     beta      mean      mode         var         sd\n1     prior 45.88581 68.68621 0.4004975 0.3987297 0.002077486 0.04557945\n2 posterior 50.88581 78.68621 0.3927222 0.3910404 0.001826513 0.04273772\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nWhile we can manually display this posterior Beta distribution with the above $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ parameters using `dbeta()` and `stat_function()`, the code chunk below displays the posterior with the prior and __scaled__ likelihood using the convenient helper function from `bayesrules`:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot_beta_binomial(alpha = prior_alpha_shape, beta = prior_beta_shape, \n                   y = 5, n = 15, # Now display the posterior\n                   prior = TRUE, likelihood = TRUE, posterior = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](11-beta-binomial_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThis connects back to the idea of __pooling__ from multilevel models: although we observe data for Caitlin Clark's shot attempts, we apply regularization and move towards the prior.\n\n## Sequential Bayesian Analysis\n\nThe Bayesian framework provides a way to incrementally update a posterior as new data arrives. We can start with a prior distribution, observe data to arrive at a posterior, __then use this posterior as a new prior__ before repeating the process as we observe new data. For instance, we can use the game log of Caitlin Clark's season to demonstrate this. Each row in `clark_game_log` corresponds to a single game. We can start with our Empirical Bayes prior from before, and update using the Beta-Binomial conjugate prior solution to arrive at the posterior for each game.
