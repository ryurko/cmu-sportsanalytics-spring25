    "text": "Working with penguins\nIn R, there are many libraries or packages/groups of programs that are not permanently stored in R, so we have to load them when we want to use them. You can load an R package by typing library(package_name). (Sometimes we need to download/install the package first, as described in HW0.)\nThroughout this demo we will use the palmerpenguins dataset. To access the data, you will need to install the palmerpenguins package:\n\ninstall.packages(\"palmerpenguins\")\n\nImport the penguins dataset by loading the palmerpenguins package using the library function and then access the data with the data() function:\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins) \ndata(penguins)\n\nView some basic info about the penguins dataset:\n\n# displays same info as c(nrow(penguins), ncol(penguins))\ndim(penguins) \n\n[1] 344   8\n\nclass(penguins)\n\n[1] \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n\n\ntbl (pronounced tibble) is the tidyverse way of storing tabular data, like a spreadsheet or data.frame\nI assure you that you’ll run into errors as you code in R; in fact, my attitude as a coder is that something is wrong if I never get any errors while working on a project. When you run into an error, your first reaction may be to panic and post a question to Piazza. However, checking help documentation in R can be a great way to figure out what’s going wrong. (For good or bad, I end up having to read help documentation almost every day of my life - because, well, I regularly make mistakes in R.)\nLook at the help documentation for penguins by typing help(penguins) in the Console. What are the names of the variables in this dataset? How many observations are in this dataset?\n\nhelp(penguins)\n\nYou should always look at your data before doing anything: view the first 6 (by default) rows with head()\n\nhead(penguins) # Try just typing penguins into your console, what happens?\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n  species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g\n  &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;fct&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7               181        3750\n2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4               186        3800\n3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                 195        3250\n4 Adelie  Torgersen           NA            NA                  NA          NA\n5 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3               193        3450\n6 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6               190        3650\n# ℹ 2 more variables: sex &lt;fct&gt;, year &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nIs our penguins dataset tidy?\n\nEach row = a single penguin\nEach column = different measurement about the penguins (can print out column names directly with colnames(penguins) or names(penguins))\n\nWe’ll now explore differences among the penguins using the tidyverse."

The code used to create this dataset is available on Canvas. The following code chunk reads in the data (notice the use of the here package for reading in the data) and displays a subset of the data:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# This assumes the dataset is saved within the data folder of the directory this\n# file is loaded in, you can change this depending on where you save the data!\nmodel_nhl_shot_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"data/model_nhl_shot_data.csv\"))\nhead(model_nhl_shot_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n    game_id period shooting_player shooting_team goalie_name goalie_team x_fixed\n      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    2.02e9      1 Bryan Rust      Pittsburgh P… Petr Mrazek Chicago Bl…     -51\n2    2.02e9      1 Kevin Korchins… Chicago Blac… Tristan Ja… Pittsburgh…     -55\n3    2.02e9      1 Noel Acciari    Pittsburgh P… Petr Mrazek Chicago Bl…      75\n4    2.02e9      1 Wyatt Kaiser    Chicago Blac… Tristan Ja… Pittsburgh…     -39\n5    2.02e9      1 Alex Vlasic     Chicago Blac… Tristan Ja… Pittsburgh…     -36\n6    2.02e9      1 Marcus Petters… Pittsburgh P… Petr Mrazek Chicago Bl…      32\n# ℹ 4 more variables: y_fixed &lt;dbl&gt;, shot_distance &lt;dbl&gt;, shot_angle &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   is_goal &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNOTE: For hockey fans, for simplicity we are only considering even-strength shot attempts with a goalie in net that were either goals or saved by the goalie (i.e., not considering shots blocked by non-goalie defenders or shots that missed wide of the net).\nBefore diving into any modeling, we should always start with exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize the data! The following figure displays the scatterplot of the shot attempts using the provided x (x_fixed) and y (y_fixed) coordinates, colored by the shot outcome (is_goal):\n\nmodel_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n  # Make a scatterplot of the shot attempts\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_fixed, y = y_fixed, color = as.factor(is_goal))) +\n  # Make sure to modify the alpha!\n  geom_point(alpha = .25) +\n  labs(x = \"x coordinate\", y = \"y coordinate\", \n       color = \"Shot outcome\") +\n  # Use the ggthemes package for colorblind friendly palette\n  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind(labels = c(\"Save\", \"Goal\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this figure, we can see a higher density of shots that were goals (indicated by orange color) closer to the two empty spaces along the endpoints of the horizontal line where y = 0 corresponding to the locations of the nets. We also see that the goals tend to be more directly in front of these locations relative to the sides. The figure provides us with some evidence that both the shot distance and angle are likely useful in predicting the probability of a goal."

The following code chunk reads in the data (notice the use of the here package for reading in the data) and displays a subset of the data:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# This assumes the dataset is saved within the data folder of the directory this\n# file is loaded in, you can change this depending on where you save the data!\nmodel_nhl_shot_data &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"data/model_nhl_shot_data.csv\"))\nhead(model_nhl_shot_data)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 11\n    game_id period shooting_player shooting_team goalie_name goalie_team x_fixed\n      &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    2.02e9      1 Bryan Rust      Pittsburgh P… Petr Mrazek Chicago Bl…     -51\n2    2.02e9      1 Kevin Korchins… Chicago Blac… Tristan Ja… Pittsburgh…     -55\n3    2.02e9      1 Noel Acciari    Pittsburgh P… Petr Mrazek Chicago Bl…      75\n4    2.02e9      1 Wyatt Kaiser    Chicago Blac… Tristan Ja… Pittsburgh…     -39\n5    2.02e9      1 Alex Vlasic     Chicago Blac… Tristan Ja… Pittsburgh…     -36\n6    2.02e9      1 Marcus Petters… Pittsburgh P… Petr Mrazek Chicago Bl…      32\n# ℹ 4 more variables: y_fixed &lt;dbl&gt;, shot_distance &lt;dbl&gt;, shot_angle &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   is_goal &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNOTE: For hockey fans, for simplicity we are only considering even-strength shot attempts with a goalie in net that were either goals or saved by the goalie (i.e., not considering shots blocked by non-goalie defenders or shots that missed wide of the net).\nBefore diving into any modeling, we should always start with exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize the data! The following figure displays the scatterplot of the shot attempts using the provided x (x_fixed) and y (y_fixed) coordinates, colored by the shot outcome (is_goal):\n\nmodel_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n  # Make a scatterplot of the shot attempts\n  ggplot(aes(x = x_fixed, y = y_fixed, color = as.factor(is_goal))) +\n  # Make sure to modify the alpha!\n  geom_point(alpha = .25) +\n  labs(x = \"x coordinate\", y = \"y coordinate\", \n       color = \"Shot outcome\") +\n  # Use the ggthemes package for colorblind friendly palette\n  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind(labels = c(\"Save\", \"Goal\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this figure, we can see a higher density of shots that were goals (indicated by orange color) closer to the two empty spaces along the endpoints of the horizontal line where y = 0 corresponding to the locations of the nets. We also see that the goals tend to be more directly in front of these locations relative to the sides. The figure provides us with some evidence that both the shot distance and angle are likely useful in predicting the probability of a goal."

    "text": "Simple logistic regression model of distance\nWe’ll start with a simple logistic regression model to estimate the goal probability of a shot as just a function of the shot distance (in feet). More specifically, we model the log-odds of a goal with a linear model:\n\\[\n\\log \\Big[ \\frac{Pr(S = 1 |\\ distance)}{Pr(S = 0 |\\ distance)} \\Big] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\cdot distance\n\\]\nBefore we fit this model, we’ll continue with some basic EDA by visualizing the relationship between the shot outcome (is_goal) and the distance (shot_distance). The following figure displays a stacked histogram of the shot distance by outcome, indicating that the majority of goals occur at much shorter distances. While the majority of shot attempts do not result in a goal, we can imagine that the probability of goal increases as the shot distance decreases.\n\nmodel_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = shot_distance, fill = as.factor(is_goal))) +\n  geom_histogram() + \n  labs(x = \"Shot distance (in feet)\",\n       y = \"Count\", fill = \"Shot outcome\") +\n  ggthemes::scale_fill_colorblind(labels = c(\"Save\", \"Goal\")) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we’re going to create an empirical logit plot to assess the linearity assumption of the logistic regression model, i.e., to check if the log(odds) is a linear function of distance. To do this, we need to bin the continuous variable of distance and then compute the log(odds) (or equivalently log(goals / saves)) within each bin. The following code chunk uses the cut_number() function to divide the shot_distance variable into bins with approximately equal number of observations. NOTE: Due to the potential for the observed proportion to be 0, in order to avoid log(0) we set a floor of 0.0001 using the pmax() function.\n\nshot_distance_summary &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n  mutate(dist_bin = cut_number(shot_distance, 10)) |&gt;\n  group_by(dist_bin) |&gt;\n  summarize(goal_p = mean(is_goal),\n            n_shots = n(),\n            dist_midpoint = median(shot_distance),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(goal_p = pmax(goal_p, 0.0001),\n         emp_logit = log(goal_p / (1 - goal_p)))\nshot_distance_summary\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 5\n   dist_bin     goal_p n_shots dist_midpoint emp_logit\n   &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 [1,9.1]     0.134      9822           7.2     -1.86\n 2 (9.1,13.9]  0.107      9848          11.2     -2.12\n 3 (13.9,20.4] 0.0931     9633          17.1     -2.28\n 4 (20.4,27.2] 0.0778     9898          24       -2.47\n 5 (27.2,33.2] 0.0599     9745          30.4     -2.75\n 6 (33.2,39.1] 0.0374     9789          36.2     -3.25\n 7 (39.1,45.9] 0.0232     9640          42.2     -3.74\n 8 (45.9,54.5] 0.0162     9800          50       -4.10\n 9 (54.5,62.6] 0.0156     9908          58.5     -4.14\n10 (62.6,189]  0.00450    9551          69.4     -5.40\n\n\nNext, we can make a simple plot with the empirical logit values along the y-axis against the shot distance (via the midpoints of the bins) on the x-axis. We can use geom_smooth() to fit a flexible trend to help us determine if the relationship is linear or not.\n\nshot_distance_summary |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = dist_midpoint, y = emp_logit)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  labs(x = \"Shot distance (midpoint of bins)\",\n       y = \"Empirical logits\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure looks reasonable in terms of indicating a linear relationship between the log(odds) of a goal and the shot distance. We see that the log(odds) decreases as the shot distance increases, i.e., the probability of a goal decreases as the shot distance increases.\nWith the assumption of a linear relationship checked off, we’ll now fit the logistic regression model using the glm() function in R. This is the general use function for fitting any generalized linear model (GLM) in R, where you just need to specify the distribution with the family argument. Although in this case we are technically modeling a variable (is_goal) that follows the Bernoulli distribution, we set family = \"binomial\" to fit the logistic regression model (since it’s a Binomial distribution with \\(n = 1\\)).\n\ninit_logit &lt;- glm(is_goal ~ shot_distance, data = model_nhl_shot_data,\n                  family = \"binomial\")\n\nWe can then view the summary of the model including coefficient estimates, deviance, etc. via the summary() function:\n\nsummary(init_logit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = is_goal ~ shot_distance, family = \"binomial\", data = model_nhl_shot_data)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n-0.6258  -0.4144  -0.2786  -0.1774   4.1872  \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

We view this figure below, with the observed goals and saves marked as points at one and zero respectively. As expected, the probability of a goal is highest for the shortest shots. And we can clearly see that the vast majority of goals are within seventy-five feet, while saved shots span the entire range.\n\nmodel_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n  mutate(xg = init_logit$fitted.values)  |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = shot_distance)) +\n  geom_jitter(aes(y = is_goal,\n                  color = as.factor(is_goal)), \n              width = 0, height = .01,\n             size = .5, alpha = 0.15) +\n  geom_line(aes(y = xg), color = \"blue\") +\n  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind(guide = \"none\") +\n  labs(x = \"Shot distance (in feet)\",\n       y = \"Predicted probability of goal (aka expected goals)\") +\n  theme_bw()"

    "text": "Likelihood-based approaches for model evaluation and comparison\nWe begin to assess this fit using traditional approaches based on likelihood criterion. Using the deviance, there are two tests we can consider:\n\nGoodness-of-Fit test: \\(H_0\\): fitted model vs \\(H_A\\): saturated model\nDrop-in-Deviance test: \\(H_0\\): reduced model vs \\(H_A\\): larger model (where reduced model is nested within larger model, e.g., reduced model contains subset of larger model predictors)\n\nWe’ll start with the goodness-of-fit test, which is testing the null hypothesis that the current model under consideration is a good fit. If we have evidence to suggest the null hypothesis is rejected, then we may be observing a lack-of-fit. We can perform this test easily in R using the pchisq() function to compution the appropriate p-value based on the assumption that under the null hypothesis, the residual deviance \\(\\sim \\chi^2\\) distribution with \\(n - p\\) degrees of freedom:\n\n1 - pchisq(init_logit$deviance, init_logit$df.residual)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nBased on this result, we have insufficient evidence to suggest a lack-of-fit. If the p-value was below an error rate threshold (e.g., 0.05) then we would reject the null, but we would not know what is driving the lack-of-fit. It may be that we’re missing important covariates and interactions, suffering from outliers, or other concerns with the distribution fit. Just because we fail to reject the null hypothesis in this example does NOT mean our model is optimal! There are other ways we will be able to improve this model, and the use of the \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution is just an approximation (not guaranteed to be correct…).\nWe can use drop-in-deviance test to compare the fitted model against the null model (intercept-only), using the same function. Under the null, the difference in the reduced model deviance and larger model deviance follows a \\(\\chi^2\\) distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the degrees of freedom between the two models. In other words, the degrees of freedom for this test is simply the number of parameters in the larger model that are not in the reduced model. The following code chunk shows how to perform this test using the pchisq function:\n\n1 - pchisq(init_logit$null.deviance - init_logit$deviance, \n           init_logit$df.null - init_logit$df.residual)\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nBased on this p-value, we have evidence in favor of the model with the shot distance variable.\nAnother way we can perform this test is to initially fit an intercept-only model (the null model) and then use the anova() function with test = \"Chisq\" specified to achieve the same result:\n\nnull_logit &lt;- glm(is_goal ~ 1, data = model_nhl_shot_data, family = \"binomial\")\nanova(null_logit, init_logit, test = \"Chisq\")\n\nAnalysis of Deviance Table\n\nModel 1: is_goal ~ 1\nModel 2: is_goal ~ shot_distance\n  Resid.

It is not an approach we can take for general comparison when considering non-nested models (e.g., two models with distinct, non-overlapping features). However, we can use information criteria measures when comparing non-nested models which consider the model’s likelihood penalized by the number of parameters in some way (i.e., penalty for model complexity). The two common information criterions are:\n\nAkaike Information Criterion (AIC) = \\(-2 \\times\\) log(Lik) \\(+ 2p\\), i.e., the more variables we use the higher the AIC\nBayesian Information Criterion (BIC) = \\(-2 \\times\\) log(Lik) \\(+ p \\log(n)\\), i.e., log of number of observations places greater penalty on each additional variable\n\nIn these forms, for both AIC and BIC, lower values are better.\nBy default, the AIC is reported in the summary() output for GLMs:\n\nsummary(dist_angle_logit)\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = is_goal ~ shot_distance + shot_angle, family = \"binomial\", \n    data = model_nhl_shot_data)\n\nDeviance Residuals: \n    Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max  \n-0.8111  -0.3907  -0.2648  -0.1798   4.1795  \n\nCoefficients:\n                Estimate Std.

There are several steps here so make sure you read through the code comments!\nThe following code chunk first creates a dataset with the relevant values for the calibration plot:\n\ninit_calibration_data &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n  # First bin the pred probs in increments of 0.05\n  mutate(bin_pred_prob = round(pred_prob / 0.05) * .05) |&gt;\n  # Group by bin_pred_prob:\n  group_by(bin_pred_prob) |&gt;\n  # Calculate the calibration results:\n  summarize(n_shots = n(),\n            # Observed proportion\n            bin_actual_prob = mean(is_goal),\n            # Compute the standard error based on the proportion and # shots\n            bin_se = sqrt((bin_actual_prob * (1 - bin_actual_prob)) / n_shots),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  # Cap the intervals to be within 0 and 1\n  mutate(bin_upper = pmin(bin_actual_prob + 2 * bin_se, 1),\n         bin_lower = pmax(bin_actual_prob - 2 * bin_se, 0))\ninit_calibration_data\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 6\n  bin_pred_prob n_shots bin_actual_prob   bin_se bin_upper bin_lower\n          &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;int&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          0      30281          0.0121 0.000629    0.0134    0.0109\n2          0.05   36884          0.0496 0.00113     0.0518    0.0473\n3          0.1    19214          0.0984 0.00215     0.103     0.0941\n4          0.15   11232          0.131  0.00319     0.138     0.125 \n5          0.2       23          0.652  0.0993      0.851     0.454 \n\n\nWe can see fairly large differences in the number of shots across the bins, which leads much wider intervals. Using this dataset, we can now create a calibration plot where we include the y = x line as reference:\n\ninit_calibration_data |&gt;\n  # Display pred probs along x and actual on y\n  ggplot(aes(x = bin_pred_prob, y = bin_actual_prob)) +\n  # Display as points \n  geom_point() +\n  # Add error bars based on standard errors:\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = bin_lower, ymax = bin_upper)) + \n  #geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", se = FALSE) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, \n              color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  labs(x = \"Estimated goal probability\",\n       y = \"Observed goal frequency\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou may also see the number of observations in each bin mapped to the size of the points, but this is effectively already accounted for via the standard error intervals:\n\ninit_calibration_data |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bin_pred_prob, y = bin_actual_prob)) +\n  # Display as points with number of shots mapped to size\n  geom_point(aes(size = n_shots)) +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = bin_lower, ymax = bin_upper)) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, \n              color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  labs(size = \"Number of shot attempts\",\n       x = \"Estimated goal probability\",\n       y = \"Observed goal frequency\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")"

    "text": "Cross-validation\nAs discussed in lecture, an expected goals model will likely be used to generate values for new shot attempts. This means we will need to take an existing model and generate predictions on new data. The alternative idea is to constantly refit the model after every single shot (or some determined batch) but that’s going to be computationally burdensome and tedious to manage. Instead, we should rely on evaluating the performance of our model based on out-of-sample performance. The most common way to do that is with \\(K\\)-fold cross-validation.\nBecause of the interesting structure of sports data, we can NOT randomly assign shots to folds. Instead, we must preserve the group structure and assign groups of observations together into the folds. For instance, in this example we will randomly assign games to folds thus ensuring that shots within the same game stay together. The following code chunk demonstrates how to first set-up a table containing only the game IDs, with 5-fold assignments and displays how many games are in each fold:\n\nset.seed(1979)\ngame_fold_table &lt;- tibble(game_id = unique(model_nhl_shot_data$game_id)) |&gt;\n  mutate(game_fold = sample(rep(1:5, length.out = n()), n()))\n\n# See how many games are in each fold:\ntable(game_fold_table$game_fold)\n\n\n  1   2   3   4   5 \n280 280 280 280 280 \n\n\nNext, we need to join the fold ids to the modeling data, so that each shot is assigned to a fold based on the game assignment:\n\nmodel_nhl_shot_data &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt; \n  left_join(game_fold_table, by = \"game_id\")\n\n# See how many shots are in each fold:\ntable(model_nhl_shot_data$game_fold)\n\n\n    1     2     3     4     5 \n19521 19754 19432 19434 19493 \n\n\nAnd finally, we can generate the holdout predictions for every shot attempt by iterating through each game fold. The following code chunk represents one way of generating the cross-validation predictions, but effectively it is just looping through the test folds, fitting the model on the training data, and storing the predictions for the test data:\n\nlogit_cv_preds &lt;- \n  map_dfr(unique(model_nhl_shot_data$game_fold), \n          function(test_fold) {\n            \n            # Separate test and training data:\n            test_data &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n              filter(game_fold == test_fold)\n            train_data &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n              filter(game_fold != test_fold)\n            \n            # Train model:\n            logit_model &lt;- glm(is_goal ~ shot_distance, \n                               data = train_data, family = \"binomial\")\n            \n            # Return tibble of holdout results:\n            tibble(test_pred_probs = predict(logit_model, newdata = test_data,\n                                             type = \"response\"),\n                   test_actual = test_data$is_goal,\n                   game_fold = test_fold) \n          })\n\nYou’ll notice that the logit_cv_preds dataset has the same number of rows as the original model dataset. This is because every observation receives a holdout prediction in cross-validation.\nWith the cross-validation predictions, we can now create a hold-out calibration plot using the same steps as before:\n\nlogit_cv_preds |&gt;\n  mutate(bin_pred_prob = round(test_pred_probs / 0.05) * .05) |&gt;\n  # Group by bin_pred_prob:\n  group_by(bin_pred_prob) |&gt;\n  # Calculate the calibration results:\n  summarize(n_shots = n(),\n            bin_actual_prob = mean(test_actual),\n            bin_se = sqrt((bin_actual_prob * (1 - bin_actual_prob)) / n_shots),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(bin_upper = pmin(bin_actual_prob + 2 * bin_se, 1),\n         bin_lower = pmax(bin_actual_prob - 2 * bin_se, 0)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bin_pred_prob, y = bin_actual_prob)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = bin_lower, ymax = bin_upper)) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, \n              color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  labs(x = \"Estimated goal probability\",\n       y = \"Observed goal frequency\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOTE: As discussed in lecture, this is slightly different than the usual cross-validation procedure of generating an estimate for a loss (or any objective function) across \\(K\\)-folds (e.g., \\(K = 5\\) estimates of RMSE), then averaging over the \\(K\\)-fold values to generate an estimate of the test loss with standard errors. The reason for this, is because the calibration plot itself is our desired quantity (one could hypothetically compute \\(K\\) estimates for each bin instead).\nWe can use cross-validation to compare and evaluate which set of features are more appropriate. For instance, the following code check generates the cross-validation predictions when using shot distance AND angle:\n\nangle_cv_preds &lt;- \n  map_dfr(unique(model_nhl_shot_data$game_fold), \n          function(test_fold) {\n            \n            # Separate test and training data:\n            test_data &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n              filter(game_fold == test_fold)\n            train_data &lt;- model_nhl_shot_data |&gt;\n              filter(game_fold != test_fold)\n            \n            # Train model:\n            logit_model &lt;- glm(is_goal ~ shot_distance + shot_angle, \n                               data = train_data, family = \"binomial\")\n            \n            # Return tibble of holdout results:\n            tibble(test_pred_probs = predict(logit_model, newdata = test_data,\n                                             type = \"response\"),\n                   test_actual = test_data$is_goal,\n                   game_fold = test_fold) \n          })\n\nWe can then stack the two datasets of predictions together, with a new column denoting what variables are in included, and then generate side-by-side calibration plots for comparison:\n\nlogit_cv_preds |&gt;\n  mutate(features = \"shot_distance\") |&gt;\n  bind_rows(mutate(angle_cv_preds, features = \"shot_distance + shot_angle\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(bin_pred_prob = round(test_pred_probs / 0.05) * .05) |&gt;\n  # Group by features AND bin_pred_prob:\n  group_by(features, bin_pred_prob) |&gt;\n  # Calculate the calibration results:\n  summarize(n_shots = n(),\n            bin_actual_prob = mean(test_actual),\n            bin_se = sqrt((bin_actual_prob * (1 - bin_actual_prob)) / n_shots),\n            .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  mutate(bin_upper = pmin(bin_actual_prob + 2 * bin_se, 1),\n         bin_lower = pmax(bin_actual_prob - 2 * bin_se, 0)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = bin_pred_prob, y = bin_actual_prob)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = bin_lower, ymax = bin_upper)) + \n  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, \n              color = \"black\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  # Facet by the features:\n  facet_wrap(~features, ncol = 2) +\n  coord_equal() + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,1)) + \n  labs(x = \"Estimated goal probability\",\n       y = \"Observed goal frequency\") + \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        strip.background = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetween these two model options, which do you think is better?"
